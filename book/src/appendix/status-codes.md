# Status Code Reference

Every `gallo_*` FFI function (except the lifecycle calls
`gallo_init`, `gallo_init_with_serial_number`, and `gallo_free`)
returns a `Status` value. `Status` is a C enum backed by
`int32_t`.

- **`Ok` (0)** — success.
- **Negative values** — errors, grouped roughly by peripheral.

## Stability

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Status code numeric values are part of the C ABI** and never
> change once shipped. Existing codes are never renumbered or
> reused; new codes are only appended at the bottom of the enum.

If you compile against a header from an older release, codes you
don't recognize will be values your code has never seen. Treat
unknown negative values as "some error" — never assume a number
that doesn't appear in your header means success.

## Source of Truth

The enum lives in
[`crates/pico-de-gallo-ffi/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/pico-de-gallo/blob/main/crates/pico-de-gallo-ffi/src/lib.rs)
and is mirrored into the generated `pico_de_gallo.h` by cbindgen.
If a code is missing from this table after a release, file an
issue — that's a documentation bug.
