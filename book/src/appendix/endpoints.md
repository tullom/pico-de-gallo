# Endpoint Catalog

This is the canonical list of postcard-rpc endpoints and topics
exposed by the Pico de Gallo firmware. The source of truth is the
`endpoints!` and `topics!` invocations in
[`crates/pico-de-gallo-internal/src/lib.rs`](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/pico-de-gallo/blob/main/crates/pico-de-gallo-internal/src/lib.rs).

> **Variant order in shared enums is part of the wire ABI.**

Each schema break bumps `SCHEMA_VERSION_MINOR` (pre-1.0). The host
library refuses to talk to a firmware whose major/minor version
doesn''t match — that''s where `Status::SchemaMismatch` (−63) comes
from.

## Topics (server → client push)

| Path           | Message     | Description                                              |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `gpio/event`   | `GpioEvent` | Push stream of edge events for subscribed GPIO pins.     |

A `gpio/event` stream is opened implicitly when you call
`gpio/subscribe` for a given pin, and closes when you
`gpio/unsubscribe`.

## Adding Endpoints

If you''re contributing a new endpoint, the recipe touches six
crates plus tests and documentation. Don''t forget the
schema-version bump and the lockstep release of internal +
firmware + every host crate.
