# Troubleshooting

## Device Doesn''t Show Up

### `gallo list` finds nothing

1. Confirm the LED on the Pico 2 is lit. If not, check the USB
   cable — many USB-C cables are power-only.
2. Confirm the firmware is flashed. Hold **BOOTSEL** while
   plugging in. If the board mounts as a `RPI-RP2` mass-storage
   device, the firmware **is not** running — see
   [Assembly & Flashing](../hardware/assembly.md).
3. **Linux**: install the udev rule from
   [USB & OS Notes](../getting-started/usb.md). Without it,
   `nusb` can''t claim the interface as a regular user.
4. **Windows**: install the WinUSB driver via Zadig. The default
   Windows USB driver does not expose vendor-specific endpoints
   to user space.
5. Check `dmesg` (Linux), Device Manager (Windows), or
   `system_profiler SPUSBDataType` (macOS) for VID `045E` and
   PID `B33C`.

### `gallo ping` fails with a comms error

A successful `gallo list` followed by a failing `gallo ping`
usually means another process has the device open — typically a
previous `gallo` instance that didn''t exit cleanly, or a Python
script holding a `PycoDeGallo`. Close it.

### `SchemaMismatch` (status code −63)

The host library was built against a different
`SCHEMA_VERSION_MINOR` than the running firmware. Re-flash the
matching firmware release, or upgrade/downgrade the host crates
to match. See [Releases & Compatibility](../internals/releases.md).

### `LegacyFirmware` (status code −64)

The firmware is too old to answer `device/info`. Re-flash a
recent firmware build.

## Peripheral Errors

### `Unsupported` (status code −65)

The peripheral exists in the protocol but isn''t wired on this
hardware revision. Check the capability bitfield from
`gallo info`. See [Revisions](../hardware/revisions.md).

### I²C `Nack` (−18)

The target didn''t acknowledge. Common causes:

- Wrong address. `gallo i2c scan` confirms which addresses ACK.
- Missing pull-ups. v1.1 boards have on-board 4.7 kΩ pull-ups;
  v1.0 does not.
- Target powered off, or VCC level mismatch (Pico de Gallo runs
  at 3.3 V on the bus pads).

### I²C `BusError` (−19) / `ArbitrationLoss` (−20)

Usually a wiring issue (long stub leads, no pull-ups, multi-master
collisions). Try a slower clock with `gallo i2c set-config --frequency standard`.

### `BufferTooLong` (−22)

The firmware caps a single transfer at 4096 bytes. Split larger
transfers, or use batch operations to keep them in one USB
round-trip even when broken into smaller chunks.

### GPIO `WrongDirection` (−28)

You read from a pin configured as output (or vice versa). Call
`gpio_set_config` first with the matching direction.

## Firmware Build Issues

### `embassy-usb-driver 0.2.1` breaks the build

A known regression. Pin `embassy-usb-driver = "=0.2.0"` in the
firmware `Cargo.toml`. See `AGENTS.md` §13.10 for the full story.

### `elf2uf2-rs 2.2.0` from crates.io is stale

The CI installs it from git because the crates.io version is
missing the `--family` flag. Use `picotool` or install from git.

## Driver Development

### "It worked over USB but not on the real MCU"

A few things to check:

- **Timing.** USB introduces ~1 ms round-trip latency. If your
  driver relies on tight inter-byte timing (some 1-Wire and
  WS2812-style protocols), the on-host loop will look fine while
  the on-target loop fails.
- **Clock speed.** Pico de Gallo''s I²C / SPI clocks are
  configurable but discrete. Confirm the target MCU''s HAL can
  produce the same speed.
- **Pull-ups and levels.** Voltage-level mismatches show up as
  intermittent NACKs.

### `transaction()` is slower than expected

If you call `embedded_hal::i2c::I2c::write_read()` or
`SpiDevice::transaction()` and it issues multiple USB round-trips,
the HAL didn''t catch the batchable case. File an issue with the
Operations list — coverage for newer trait shapes is an active
work area.
