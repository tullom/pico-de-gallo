# Wire Protocol & Schema Versioning

The wire protocol is the most important compatibility contract in Pico de
Gallo. All protocol types live in `pico-de-gallo-internal`, and both the host
and the firmware compile against that crate.

## postcard encoding rules

Pico de Gallo uses [postcard](https://docs.rs/postcard) for compact binary
encoding. That brings one rule that every contributor must understand.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> postcard encodes enum variants by **variant index**, not by the numeric value

So this is safe:

- append a new enum variant at the end.

And this is breaking:

- reorder variants,
- remove a variant,
- rename a variant that old peers still expect.

The warning comments in `pico-de-gallo-internal` are there for a reason; keep
them.

## The shared protocol crate

`pico-de-gallo-internal` defines:

- endpoint marker types,
- request and response structs,
- topic message types,
- protocol constants like `MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE`,
- schema-version constants generated at build time.

The crate also uses the `use-std` feature to switch certain response types
between owned host buffers and borrowed firmware buffers:

- host build: `Vec<u8>`
- firmware build: `&[u8]`

That lets the host own received data while the firmware can answer from a shared
scratch buffer without heap allocation.

## Endpoints and topics

Endpoints are normal request/response RPCs declared with `endpoints!`. Topics
are push-style messages declared with `topics!`.

In practice:

- endpoints cover commands like `i2c/read`, `spi/transfer`, and `device/info`,
- topics cover asynchronous server-to-client events.

Today the main topic is GPIO event streaming:

| Kind | Example | Direction | Purpose |
|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Endpoint | `i2c/read` | host → device → host | Request/response RPC |
| Endpoint | `device/info` | host → device → host | Compatibility probe |
| Topic | `gpio/event` | device → host | Push edge notifications |

A short slice of the endpoint catalog looks like this:

| Path | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `ping` | Echo test payload |
| `version` | Report firmware version |
| `device/info` | Report firmware, schema, and capabilities |
| `i2c/read` | Read from an I<sup>2</sup>C target |
| `spi/transfer` | Full-duplex SPI transfer |
| `gpio/subscribe` | Start GPIO event monitoring |

For the full list, see the [Endpoint Catalog](../appendix/endpoints.md).

## Schema versioning

The schema version constants are not handwritten. `pico-de-gallo-internal`
generates `SCHEMA_VERSION_MAJOR`, `SCHEMA_VERSION_MINOR`, and
`SCHEMA_VERSION_PATCH` in `build.rs` from the crate's `[package].version`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not edit `SCHEMA_VERSION_*` constants directly. Bump the
> `pico-de-gallo-internal` crate version and let `build.rs` regenerate them.

Before 1.0, the **minor** version is the breaking axis. After 1.0, that role
moves to the major version.

That means a pre-1.0 bump is required when you:

- add or remove an endpoint or topic,
- change a request or response type,
- append a new wire enum variant.

## Host/firmware compatibility checks

The host library exposes `PicoDeGallo::validate()`. It calls `device/info`,
reads the firmware's schema version, and rejects mismatches early.

If validation fails, the host returns:

- `LegacyFirmware` when the firmware is too old to support `device/info`, or
- `SchemaMismatch` when the host and firmware disagree on the schema version.

This turns an otherwise confusing runtime failure into an explicit compatibility
error.

## Lockstep releases for protocol changes

A wire change is never just one crate. Per the project rules, the same release
cycle must update:

1. `pico-de-gallo-internal`,
2. `pico-de-gallo-firmware`,
3. `pico-de-gallo-lib`,
4. `pico-de-gallo-hal`,
5. `pico-de-gallo-ffi`,
6. `pico-de-gallo-app`,
7. `pyco-de-gallo`.
