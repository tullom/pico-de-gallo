# `gallo` CLI

`gallo` is the fastest way to prove your board works, poke a device, and turn a
manual experiment into a repeatable command. It sits on top of
`pico-de-gallo-lib`, so the CLI and the Rust library speak the same protocol and
see the same capabilities.

Use it for:

- bring-up and smoke tests,
- one-off I<sup>2</sup>C / SPI / UART / GPIO / PWM / ADC / 1-Wire operations,
- shell scripting,
- discovering which board is which when several are plugged in.

## Global Options

### `-s, --serial-number`

If more than one Pico de Gallo is attached, `gallo` would otherwise use the
first matching device the OS reports. Pass `-s` to make board selection
explicit.

```console
$ gallo list
Serial Number         Bus    Address
E6633861A34B8C24      2      14
E6633861A34B9F17      1      8

$ gallo -s E6633861A34B9F17 version
Firmware version: 0.1.0
```

### `-f, --format hex|binary|ascii`

The global `-f` flag controls how read-style commands print data:

- `hex` — hexadecimal bytes,
- `binary` — raw bytes to stdout,
- `ascii` — printable characters, with non-printable bytes shown as `.`.

```console
$ gallo -f ascii uart read --count 5 --timeout 100
Hello
```

> [!TIP]
> `binary` is the right choice when you want to pipe the output into another
> program without pretty-printing in the way.

## Device Discovery Commands

### `list`

Lists every connected Pico de Gallo device the host can see.

```console
$ gallo list
Serial Number         Bus    Address
E6633861A34B8C24      2      14
```

### `version`

Queries the connected board for its firmware version.

```console
$ gallo version
Firmware version: 0.1.0
```

## Peripheral Command Groups

### `i2c`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scan` | Probe the bus for responding addresses |
| `read` | Read bytes from one target address |
| `write` | Write bytes to one target address |
| `write-read` | Write first, then read from the same target without releasing the bus |
| `set-config` | Set the I<sup>2</sup>C frequency |
| `get-config` | Show the active I<sup>2</sup>C frequency |
| `batch` | Execute several I<sup>2</sup>C operations in one USB transfer |

See the [I<sup>2</sup>C chapter](../interfaces/i2c.md) and
[Transaction Batching](../interfaces/batching.md) for examples.

### `spi`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read` | Clock in bytes |
| `write` | Clock out bytes |
| `transfer` | Full-duplex SPI transfer |
| `write-read` | Half-duplex write followed by read |
| `set-config` | Set frequency, phase, and polarity |
| `get-config` | Show the active SPI configuration |
| `batch` | Run atomic multi-step SPI transactions under chip-select |

See the [SPI chapter](../interfaces/spi.md) and
[Transaction Batching](../interfaces/batching.md).

### `gpio`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `get` | Read the current level of a pin |
| `put` | Drive a pin high or low |
| `set-config` | Set direction and pull resistor |
| `monitor` | Subscribe to edge events until you stop the process |

See the [GPIO chapter](../interfaces/gpio.md).

### `uart`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read` | Read bytes with a timeout |
| `write` | Write raw bytes |
| `flush` | Wait for the transmit buffer to drain |
| `set-config` | Set baud rate |
| `get-config` | Show the active UART configuration |

See the [UART chapter](../interfaces/uart.md).

### `pwm`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `set-duty` | Set a raw duty-cycle value |
| `get-duty` | Read current and maximum duty |
| `enable` | Enable the slice behind a channel |
| `disable` | Disable the slice behind a channel |
| `set-config` | Set frequency and phase-correct mode |
| `get-config` | Show the active PWM configuration |

See the [PWM chapter](../interfaces/pwm.md).

### `adc`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read` | Read one ADC sample |
| `info` | Show ADC resolution, reference, and channel count |

See the [ADC chapter](../interfaces/adc.md).

### `onewire`

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `reset` | Reset the bus and report presence |
| `read` | Read raw bytes |
| `write` | Write raw bytes |
| `write-pullup` | Write, then hold the line high for parasitic-power devices |
| `search` | Enumerate ROM IDs on the bus |

See the [1-Wire chapter](../interfaces/onewire.md).

## A Few Crisp Examples

```console
$ gallo i2c get-config
$ gallo spi get-config
$ gallo uart set-config --baud-rate 115200
$ gallo gpio monitor --pin 0 --edge rising
$ gallo adc read --channel 0
$ gallo onewire search
```

That is the right mental model for `gallo`: short commands, explicit arguments,
and results you can immediately paste into a shell script or lab notebook.
