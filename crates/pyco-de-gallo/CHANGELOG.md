## [0.3.0](https://github.com/tullom/pico-de-gallo/compare/pyco-v0.2.0...pyco-v0.3.0) (2026-06-03)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **internal,firmware,lib,hal,ffi,application,pyco:** pico-de-gallo-internal gains the `system/reset-subscriptions` endpoint; postcard-rpc requires firmware and every host crate to be rebuilt against the matching SCHEMA_VERSION_MINOR. Mixing a 0.5.x firmware with a 0.6.x host (or vice versa) will fail `validate()` with a schema-version mismatch. Additionally, the FFI handle-borrowing entry points now take `*const PicoDeGallo`; this is source-compatible for C consumers but technically a signature change.

### Features

* **internal,firmware,lib,hal,ffi,application,pyco:** address P1 review findings ([00ea9df](https://github.com/tullom/pico-de-gallo/commit/00ea9dfde78dd8ec531cfdd986b7205671d2ae25))
