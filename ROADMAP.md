### What's Missing

Compared to what embedded developers routinely need, pico-de-gallo is
missing:

- **UART** — the single most common debug/console interface
- **PWM** — needed by motor drivers, LED controllers, servos
- **ADC** — needed for voltage monitoring, analog sensors
- **SpiDevice** — most crates.io SPI drivers use `SpiDevice` (with CS
  management), not raw `SpiBus`
- **10-bit I2C** — some devices use extended addressing
- **I2C bus scan** — the first thing anyone does when debugging I2C
- **Rich errors** — current failure types are unit structs with no detail
- **UART/serial traits** — `embedded-io` Read/Write for serial drivers
- **Voltage flexibility** — hardware is 3.3 V only; no path to 1.8 V or 5 V
- **Target power** — users must externally power their target
- **Event notifications** — no way for firmware to push GPIO changes or
  bus events to the host

---

## Design Philosophy

Pico de Gallo's unique value proposition is not raw speed or protocol
coverage — commercial bridges like the FT2232H and Total Phase Aardvark
will always win on throughput and polish. The value is:

> **Any driver on crates.io that uses `embedded-hal` traits can be
> developed and tested on a host PC using pico-de-gallo as the hardware
> backend.**

Every design decision should maximize embedded-hal trait coverage and
driver compatibility. If a driver author uses `I2c + OutputPin + DelayNs`
(the most common combination), pico-de-gallo should Just Work™.

The priority order for trait implementations is driven by how commonly
each trait appears in crates.io drivers:

1. `I2c` — ✅ done
2. `SpiDevice` / `SpiBus` — `SpiBus` done, **`SpiDevice` missing**
3. `OutputPin` / `InputPin` — ✅ done
4. `DelayNs` — ✅ done
5. `embedded-io Read/Write` (UART) — ✅ done
6. `SetDutyCycle` (PWM) — **implemented** (Phase 2.2)

## Phase 1 — Polish What Exists

*Complexity: low. No new hardware. Mostly non-breaking changes.*

These are quality improvements that make the existing feature set more
reliable and complete before adding new capabilities.

### 1.1 Rich Error Types

**What:** Replace unit-struct failures (`I2cReadFail`, `SpiWriteFail`, etc.)
with enums carrying error detail from the firmware.

**Why:** When an I2C write fails, the user currently gets `I2cWriteFail` with
no indication whether it was a NACK, bus timeout, arbitration loss, or
firmware bug. Real embedded-hal `ErrorKind` variants (`NoAcknowledge`,
`Bus`, `ArbitrationLoss`, `Overrun`) should propagate from firmware through
the host crates.

**Impact:** Breaking change to internal + lib + hal. This is the single most
impactful quality improvement possible.

```
Firmware  →  I2cError::Nack  →  postcard  →  lib  →  hal  →  ErrorKind::NoAcknowledge
```

### 1.2 SpiDevice Trait Implementation

**What:** Implement `embedded_hal::spi::SpiDevice` (and the async variant)
in the HAL crate, with firmware-managed CS assertion.

**Why:** Most SPI drivers on crates.io use `SpiDevice`, not `SpiBus`.
`SpiDevice` wraps a full CS-assert → transfer → CS-deassert transaction.
Without it, users must manually wrap `SpiBus` with `embedded-hal-bus`
adapters, which adds friction and can be error-prone over USB.

**Design:** Add a firmware endpoint `spi/transaction` that holds CS low
across a sequence of operations, or use one of the existing GPIO pins as a
firmware-controlled CS with automatic assertion on each SPI endpoint call.

### 1.3 I2C Bus Scan Endpoint

**What:** Add an `i2c/scan` endpoint that probes all 7-bit addresses
(0x08–0x77) and returns a list of responding addresses.

**Why:** This is the first thing every embedded developer does when hooking
up an I2C bus. Every competing tool has it. The CLI app should print a
nice matrix like `i2cdetect`.

### 1.4 GPIO Direction Control

**What:** Add endpoints to configure individual GPIO pins as input or
output at runtime, with optional pull-up/pull-down configuration.

**Why:** Currently the firmware decides pin direction. Users should be able
to reconfigure pins dynamically — this is especially important for
open-drain protocols and bidirectional signaling.

### 1.5 Configuration Query Endpoints

**What:** Add `i2c/get-config` and `spi/get-config` endpoints that return
the current bus configuration.

**Why:** When writing multi-step automation scripts or debugging, it's
useful to confirm what configuration is active without relying on
local state.

### 1.6 MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE Audit

**What:** `pico-de-gallo-internal` defines `MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE = 4096`, but
comments in `pico-de-gallo-lib` still reference `512`. Audit and
synchronize all documentation and buffer sizes.

**Why:** Mismatched expectations between crates could cause silent data
truncation.

---

## Phase 2 — New Protocols (Software Only)

*Complexity: medium. No new hardware required (pins are already broken out
on the Pico 2 module), but requires new firmware drivers and new
endpoint families.*

| ☐ | [2.6 10-Bit I2C Addressing](#26-10-bit-i2c-addressing) | [#12](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/pico-de-gallo/issues/12) |

### 2.1 UART Support

**What:** Implement UART bridging using RP2350's UART0 peripheral. Add
endpoints for read, write, and configuration (baud rate, data bits,
parity, stop bits). Implement `embedded_io::Read` and `embedded_io::Write`
(plus async variants) in the HAL crate.

**Why:** UART is the most universal embedded interface. It's used for:
- Serial console access
- Bootloader communication
- GPS modules, cellular modems, Bluetooth modules
- Debug logging
- Firmware upload/recovery

Not having UART is the single biggest functional gap compared to every
competing tool. Even the $4 CH340 does UART.

**Pin assignment:** Use GPIO0 (TX) and GPIO1 (RX) — these are the default
UART0 pins and are directly accessible on the Pico 2 header.

**Hardware note:** UART doesn't need board changes. The Pico 2's GPIO0/1
are already on the module header. A future board revision could add a
dedicated UART header/connector, but it's not required.

**Baud rates:** Support standard rates: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200,
230400, 460800, 921600. Expose as a plain `u32` — the RP2350 will silently
clamp out-of-range values. Data bits, parity, and stop bits are deferred
to a future version (requires unsafe PAC register writes while interrupts
are active).

### 2.2 PWM Support

**What:** Expose 2–4 PWM outputs using RP2350's PWM slices. Add endpoints
for setting frequency, duty cycle, enable/disable. Implement the
`embedded_hal::pwm::SetDutyCycle` trait in the HAL crate.

**Why:** PWM is essential for:
- Servo control
- LED brightness (backlight controllers, RGB LEDs)
- Motor drivers
- Buzzer/audio tone generation
- Power supply enable/control

The `SetDutyCycle` trait is the last "common" embedded-hal trait not
implemented. Adding it means pico-de-gallo covers every standard trait
in embedded-hal 1.0.

**Pin assignment:** Repurpose 2–4 of the current GPIO pins (GPIO8–15 map
to PWM slices 4–7), or use additional Pico 2 header pins. PWM and GPIO
can coexist — a pin configured for PWM simply stops being a
general-purpose GPIO until reconfigured.

### 2.3 ADC Support

**What:** Expose RP2350's ADC channels (GPIO26–29 = ADC0–3).
Add endpoints for single-shot reads and
optionally continuous sampling. There is no standard embedded-hal ADC trait
in 1.0, so expose a project-specific API.

**Why:** ADC enables:
- Voltage monitoring (power rails, battery levels)
- Analog sensor reading (thermistors, potentiometers, light sensors)
- Signal level debugging

**Resolution:** RP2350 has a 12-bit ADC with 500 ksps. Single-shot reads
are simple; continuous streaming would benefit from DMA but pushes against
USB FS bandwidth limits for high sample rates.

**Hardware note:** GPIO26–29 are on the Pico 2 module header. No board
change needed, but a future revision should break these out to dedicated
ADC-labeled headers.

### 2.4 Second I2C Bus

**What:** Enable I2C0 in addition to the existing I2C1. Extend all I2C
endpoints to accept a bus identifier.

**Why:** Many real-world designs use two I2C buses — one for sensors, one
for EEPROMs/PMICs, or separate buses to avoid address conflicts. Two buses
also enable bus isolation testing.

**Pin assignment:** I2C0 on GPIO20/21 (available on Pico 2 header).

### 2.5 Second SPI Bus

**What:** Enable SPI1 in addition to SPI0. Extend all SPI endpoints to
accept a bus identifier.

**Why:** Less critical than second I2C (SPI uses CS pins for device
selection), but useful for testing multi-bus designs or when different SPI
devices need different clock/polarity settings.

**Pin assignment:** SPI1 on GPIO16–19 (available on Pico 2 header).

### 2.6 10-Bit I2C Addressing

**What:** Support `TenBitAddress` in addition to `SevenBitAddress` for I2C
operations.

**Why:** Some devices (particularly EEPROMs with large address spaces) use
10-bit addressing. The `embedded_hal::i2c::I2c` trait is generic over
address type, so the HAL should implement both.

---

## Phase 3 — Advanced Features

*Complexity: high. Software only, but requires deeper firmware
architecture changes.*

| ☐ | [3.6 Multi-Device Host](#36-multi-device-host-support)            | [#18](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/pico-de-gallo/issues/18) |

### 3.1 GPIO Event Topics (Push Notifications)

**What:** Use postcard-rpc's topic mechanism (currently unused —
`TOPICS_IN_LIST` and `TOPICS_OUT_LIST` are empty) to push GPIO state
changes from firmware to host without polling.

**Why:** Polling `gpio/wait-*` endpoints ties up a USB transfer for each
pin being monitored. With topics, the firmware can notify the host of edge
events asynchronously. This enables interrupt-driven workflows and is
closer to how real embedded systems handle GPIO interrupts.

**Design:** Define a `GpioEvent` topic containing `{ pin: u8, state:
GpioState, timestamp_us: u64 }`. The host subscribes and receives events
as they occur.

### 3.2 I2C/SPI Transaction Batching

**What:** Allow a sequence of I2C or SPI operations to be sent as a single
USB transfer and executed atomically on the firmware side.

**Why:** Each USB round-trip adds 1–2 ms of latency. For multi-register
reads or device initialization sequences that require dozens of
operations, the cumulative latency dominates. Batching could speed up
EEPROM programming by 10–50×.

**Design:** A new `i2c/batch` endpoint that accepts a `Vec<I2cOperation>`
and returns `Vec<I2cResult>`. Similar for SPI.

### 3.3 1-Wire Support via PIO

**What:** Implement 1-Wire protocol using RP2350's PIO (Programmable I/O)
state machine. Embassy-rp already has a PIO 1-Wire program.

**Why:** 1-Wire is used by DS18B20 temperature sensors (extremely popular),
iButton devices, and some ID/authentication chips. It's a niche but
well-loved protocol that few USB bridges support — this would be a genuine
differentiator.

**Complexity:** PIO programming is non-trivial, but embassy-rp's existing
`pio_programs/onewire.rs` provides a starting point.

### 3.4 Protocol Sniffing / Logic Capture

**What:** Use a PIO state machine to passively monitor an I2C or SPI bus
and stream decoded frames to the host.

**Why:** This transforms pico-de-gallo from a pure master/controller into
a debugging tool. Being able to sniff what's happening on a bus (even one
driven by a different controller) is invaluable for hardware debugging.

**Limitations:** USB FS bandwidth caps continuous capture at ~700 KB/s
raw throughput. This is adequate for I2C (max 1 MHz = 125 KB/s) and
moderate SPI, but not for high-speed SPI or comprehensive logic analysis.
This is NOT a Saleae replacement — it's a "quick look at what's on the
bus" tool.

### 3.5 Configuration Persistence

**What:** Store the current bus configurations (I2C frequency, SPI mode,
GPIO directions, UART baud rate) in RP2350's flash so they survive
power cycles.

**Why:** Users who always work with the same target shouldn't have to
reconfigure on every plug-in. Useful for production test fixtures that
need deterministic startup.

### 3.6 Multi-Device Host Support

**What:** Allow multiple host applications to connect to separate
interfaces on the same pico-de-gallo simultaneously (e.g., one app uses
I2C, another uses UART).

**Why:** In complex setups, different tools may need to access different
buses. This requires firmware-side resource locking and multiple USB
endpoints or interfaces.

## Phase 4 — Hardware Rev 2

*Complexity: high. Requires PCB re-spin, component sourcing, and
potentially case redesign.*

This is the section that addresses the board re-spin directly. Changes are
ordered by impact-to-cost ratio.

|   | Item                                                             | Tracking |

| ☐ | [4.6 Board Size and Mounting](#46-board-size-and-mounting)       | [#25](https://github.com/OpenDevicePartnership/pico-de-gallo/issues/25) |

### 4.1 Voltage Level Translators

**Priority: CRITICAL — the single most impactful hardware change.**

**What:** Add bidirectional voltage level translators between the RP2350
(3.3 V) and the target connectors, with a user-selectable target voltage
(VREF) pin.

**Why:** The embedded world runs at many voltages:

| Voltage | Common Uses                                                    |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.8 V   | Modern SoCs, LPDDR interfaces, low-power sensors               |
| 2.5 V   | Some FPGAs, legacy parts                                       |
| 3.3 V   | Most microcontrollers, sensors, EEPROMs                        |
| 5.0 V   | Arduino ecosystem, RS-232 level, automotive, legacy industrial |

Without level translators, pico-de-gallo is limited to 3.3 V targets.
This excludes a huge portion of the embedded ecosystem, especially:
- 5 V Arduino shields and legacy sensors
- 1.8 V modern SoC I2C buses (increasingly common)
- Mixed-voltage designs where the bridge must match the target

**Recommended parts:**

| Bus        | Part                            | Notes                                                                                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I2C        | **PCA9306** or **TXS0102**      | Bidirectional, open-drain compatible, designed for I2C. Do NOT use TXB0108 for I2C — it fights the open-drain pull-ups. |
| SPI / GPIO | **TXB0108** or **SN74LVC8T245** | Unidirectional or auto-direction. The SN74LVC8T245 is more predictable for high-speed SPI.                              |
| UART       | **SN74LVC2T45**                 | 2-channel, dual-supply. TX is always host→target, RX is target→host, so direction is fixed.                             |

**Design approach:**
- Add a **VREF pin** on the target connector. The user supplies target
  voltage on this pin (or a jumper selects from 3.3 V / 5 V).
- Level translators reference VREF on the target side and 3.3 V on the
  RP2350 side.
- If VREF is not supplied, the translators can be powered from the
  on-board 3.3 V rail (passthrough mode, no translation).

### 4.2 Target Power Output

**What:** Provide switchable 3.3 V and 5 V power outputs to power small
target boards directly from USB.

**Why:** When prototyping with a single sensor or small target board,
needing a separate power supply is friction. The Total Phase Aardvark
provides target power and it's one of its most-loved features.

**Implementation:**
- **5 V:** Directly from USB VBUS through a current-limited switch
  (e.g., TPS2051B, 500 mA limit).
- **3.3 V:** From the Pico 2's on-board regulator or a dedicated LDO,
  also current-limited.
- **Control:** A GPIO pin enables/disables target power via firmware. Add
  a `power/enable` endpoint.
- **Protection:** Include a polyfuse or electronic fuse to protect against
  target short circuits.

**Budget:** USB 2.0 provides 500 mA total. The Pico 2 itself draws
~30–50 mA. Safely offer 200–300 mA to targets.

### 4.3 Dedicated Connector Layout

**What:** Redesign the connector layout with labeled, purpose-specific
headers:

| Connector | Type                                      | Pins                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **I2C**   | JST SH 4-pin (Qwiic/STEMMA QT compatible) | VCC, GND, SDA, SCL                       |
| **SPI**   | 2×4 pin header                            | VCC, GND, SCK, MOSI, MISO, CS0, CS1, CS2 |
| **UART**  | 1×4 pin header                            | VCC, GND, TX, RX                         |
| **GPIO**  | 2×5 pin header                            | 8× GPIO + GND + VREF                     |
| **ADC**   | 1×6 pin header                            | 4× ADC channels + GND + VREF             |
| **PWM**   | 1×4 pin header                            | 2–4× PWM outputs + GND                   |
| **Power** | 1×3 pin header                            | 5V, 3.3V, GND                            |

**Why the Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector matters:** The JST SH 4-pin I2C
connector is a de facto standard in the maker/prototyping ecosystem.
SparkFun (Qwiic) and Adafruit (STEMMA QT) both use it. Adding one means
users can plug in any Qwiic/STEMMA sensor board with a single cable — no
wiring, no breadboard.

### 4.4 ESD Protection

**What:** Add ESD protection diodes (e.g., TPD4E05U06 for 4-channel, or
PRTR5V0U2X for USB/I2C) on all external-facing signal lines.

**Why:** USB bridges get plugged and unplugged constantly, often into
unknown targets. A single ESD event can destroy the RP2350. This is
table stakes for any tool that's meant to be handled daily.

**Cost:** Negligible — TVS diode arrays are $0.10–0.30 each.

### 4.5 Activity LEDs

**What:** Add per-bus activity LEDs:

| LED   | Color       | Indicates             |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Power | Green       | Board powered         |
| USB   | Blue        | USB enumerated        |
| I2C   | Yellow      | I2C bus activity      |
| SPI   | Orange      | SPI bus activity      |
| UART  | Red         | UART TX/RX activity   |
| Error | Red (blink) | Last operation failed |

**Why:** Visual feedback is surprisingly important for debugging. "Is it
even talking to the bus?" is a question users ask constantly. A quick
glance at blinking LEDs answers it immediately.

**Implementation:** Use remaining GPIOs to drive LEDs. The firmware
toggles them in the endpoint handlers. Total current draw: ~12 mA for
6 LEDs at 2 mA each.

### 4.6 Board Size and Mounting

**What:** Consider whether the case design needs updating for the new
connectors. The current design uses M3 mounting holes; keep those but
potentially expand the PCB footprint to accommodate level translators and
additional connectors.

**Tradeoff:** A larger board costs more to fabricate and doesn't fit the
current 3D-printed case, but a cramped board with too-small connectors is
worse.

## Should the RP2350 Stay?

**Short answer: Yes.**

### The Case For RP2350

| Factor              | Assessment                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Price**           | ~$1 chip, ~$5 Pico 2 board. Unbeatable.                                                                                  |
| **Embassy support** | First-class. Active upstream development.                                                                                |
| **Peripheral set**  | 2× I2C, 2× SPI, 2× UART, 12× PWM, 4× ADC, 3× PIO — more than enough.                                                     |
| **PIO**             | Unique advantage. Enables 1-Wire, protocol sniffing, custom protocols. No competitor at this price has anything similar. |
| **SRAM**            | 520 KB. Plenty for USB buffers and protocol state.                                                                       |
| **Dual-core**       | Available if needed for parallel bus monitoring.                                                                         |
| **Community**       | Huge Raspberry Pi ecosystem. Easy to source globally.                                                                    |
| **Tooling**         | UF2 flashing, SWD debug, picotool — all mature.                                                                          |

### The USB Full Speed Question

The RP2350 only supports USB Full Speed (12 Mbps). In practice, bulk
transfers achieve ~700 KB/s to ~1 MB/s. Is this a problem?

**For I2C:** No. I2C Fast+ (the fastest mode pico-de-gallo supports) runs
at 1 MHz = 125 KB/s. USB FS has 5–8× headroom.

**For SPI:** Marginal. SPI at 8 MHz full-duplex = 1 MB/s, which is right
at the USB FS ceiling. For sustained streaming (e.g., display refresh),
USB becomes the bottleneck. For transactional workloads (register reads,
EEPROM pages), it's fine because the per-transfer overhead dominates
anyway.

**For UART:** No. Even at 921600 baud, that's only ~92 KB/s. Trivial for
USB FS.

**For ADC:** Depends on sample rate. Single-shot reads are fine.
Continuous streaming at 500 ksps × 12-bit = 750 KB/s — right at the
limit. A practical continuous mode would need to decimate or buffer.

**For protocol sniffing:** USB FS is the real constraint. I2C sniffing is
comfortable; SPI sniffing at high clock rates would need on-device
buffering and burst transfers.

**The Total Phase Aardvark also uses USB Full Speed** and is the industry
standard at $375. If it's good enough for professional engineers paying
$375, it's good enough for pico-de-gallo.

### What Would USB High Speed Buy?

If USB HS were critical, the alternatives are:

| MCU             | USB                       | Price         | Embassy Support     | Notes                                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **STM32F723**   | HS with internal PHY      | ~$8           | Yes (embassy-stm32) | Rare chip with built-in HS PHY. Limited availability. |
| **STM32H7xx**   | HS with external ULPI PHY | ~$12 + $3 PHY | Yes (embassy-stm32) | Complex layout, BGA packages, 4+ layer PCB.           |
| **ESP32-S3**    | FS only                   | ~$3           | No (no embassy)     | Same FS limitation, worse ecosystem.                  |
| **NXP i.MX RT** | HS with internal PHY      | ~$10          | Experimental        | Overkill. Cortex-M7, complex clock tree.              |

**Verdict:** Moving to USB HS would 3-5× the BOM cost, require a 4-layer
PCB, and add significant design complexity — all for a throughput gain
that only matters in a few niche scenarios (continuous high-speed SPI
streaming, high-rate ADC capture). The RP2350's PIO capability, price,
and Embassy support make it the right choice for a tool focused on
driver development and hardware prototyping.

**Recommendation:** Keep RP2350. If a "Pro" variant is ever warranted,
the STM32F723 (HS PHY built-in) would be the most practical upgrade path,
but that's a separate product, not a replacement.

**Unique differentiators at 1.0:**
1. Only bridge with native `embedded-hal` trait support
2. Only bridge that's both open-source hardware AND Rust-native
3. Price/feature ratio competitive with Bus Pirate, with far better
   Rust integration
4. PIO enables custom protocols no other bridge at this price can match

**Conclusion:** The RP2350 has substantial unused peripheral capacity.
We can implement every feature in this roadmap without running out of
resources. The main constraint is USB bandwidth, not peripheral count.

## Summary

The path to 1.0 is primarily a **software effort**. The RP2350 hardware
is capable of far more than we currently use. The recommended sequence:

1. **Phase 1** (polish) — can start immediately, mostly non-breaking
2. **Phase 2** (new protocols) — the big value add; UART is the priority
3. **Phase 3** (advanced) — differentiating features; topics and batching
   have the highest impact
4. **Phase 4** (hardware) — plan the Rev 2 board in parallel with Phase 2
   software work; order prototypes during Phase 3
5. **Phase 5** (release) — 1.0 when all must-have criteria are met

The hardware re-spin should be done **once** with all changes in this
document. Level translators and ESD protection are the non-negotiable
additions. Target power and the Qwiic connector are high-value, low-cost
additions that should be included. Activity LEDs are nice to have if board
space permits.

The RP2350 is the right MCU. Keep it.

## Conventions — How to Update This File

### Checking off items

When a phase item is complete, update its row in the phase summary table:

```
| ☑ | [1.3 I2C Bus Scan](#13-i2c-bus-scan-endpoint) | #42 |
```

Then update the [Progress Overview](#progress-overview) table: increment
the "Done" column and update the status emoji:

- 🔴 Not started (0 done)
- 🟡 In progress (some done)
- 🟢 Complete (all done)

### Linking issues and PRs

Use the **Tracking** column to record the GitHub issue or PR number that
implements the item. Use `#N` format for issues/PRs in this repo:

```
| ☐ | [2.1 UART Support](#21-uart-support) | #57, #63 |
```

### Adding new items

If a new work item is discovered:

1. Add it to the appropriate phase as a new subsection (e.g., `### 2.7 ...`)
2. Add a row to that phase's summary table
3. Update the item count in the Progress Overview
4. If it's a 1.0 requirement, add a row to Phase 5

### Updating the date

Update the `> Last updated:` line at the top whenever you commit changes
to this file.
